# Forecast Financial Ratio - An Alternative Approach

## Objective
Financial analyst and regulators often rely on the ratio analysis to investigate a company. For example, the current ratio has to be above a certain threshold to be considered liquid.

Among ```36,136``` SEC registered companies, ```4,325``` companies are foreign owned business. For example, GOLDMAN SACHS BANK AG, Novartis, Spotify,Toyota ...

Foreign owned companies might do business in a different manner, that analysts may want to change the threshold for foreign owned companies.

My goal is to compare the performance and capital governance of US-owned business with foreign-owned business and find out structural differences. 

```Expected results```<br>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Chinese-owned companies in X industry carry y% more cash comparing with US-owned companies.</li>
  
  <li>Japanese-owned companies has higher kurtosis in term of operating profit margin.</li>
  
  <li>Swedish-owned companies are more sensitive to inflation then US companies.</li>
</ul>
  

[My plan to answer the question](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)<br>
  Step 1: A full spectrum financial statement analysis to evaluate business risk and financial risk over time. Build structured panel dataset with following features (X):<br>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Earning: EPS, diluted EPS, Net Income, EBITDA</li>
  <li>Leverage ratios: DOL,DFL,DTL</li>
  <li>Working Capital: Current Ratio, turnovers</li>
  <li>Risk: Credit risk, Liquidity risk</li>
  <li>P/E ratio, growth of P/E ratio</li>
  <li>Growth rates</li>
  </ul>
  
  Step 2: Compare portfolio of US-owned companies with portfolio of foreign-owned companies.
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Compare the mean of X:</li>
     <ul type="bullet">
     <li>H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>foreign</sub>=&mu;<sub>US</sub></li>
     <li>H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>foreign</sub>>&mu;<sub>US</sub></li>
     <li>H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>foreign</sub><&mu;<sub>US</sub></li>
     </ul>   
  
  <li>Compare distribution<br> 
  
 Step 3: Construct time series sample to test sensitivity.
  <li>Test cyclical property: </li>
     <ul type="bullet">
     <li>Both US-owned and foreign-owned companies are cyclical/non-cyclical</li>
     <li>US-owned companies are cyclical; foreign-owned companies are non-cyclical</li>
     <li>US-owned companies are non-cyclical; foreign-owned companies are cyclical</li>
     </ul>  
  </ul>
  
## Data

<a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">```EDGAR```</a> is the major data source of this project. EDGAR is maintained by the Securities Exchange Committee, free to access to the public. According to SEC,<i> "All companies, foreign and domestic, are required to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically through EDGAR."</i> Small business is not usually required to file with SEC electronicly. Banks file with FDIC and other banking industry regulators.
