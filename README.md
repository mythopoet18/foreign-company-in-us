My plan to answer the question:<br>
  A full spectrum financial statement analysis. 

<h4> <i> Data</i> </h4>

<a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">EDGAR</a> is the major data source of this project. EDGAR is maintained by the Securities Exchange Committee, free to access to the public. According to SEC,<i> "All companies, foreign and domestic, are required to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically through EDGAR."</i> Small business is not usually required to file with SEC electronicly. Banks file with FDIC and other banking industry regulators.

The size of all text form data is 40G.
