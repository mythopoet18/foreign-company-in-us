# Foreign companies in the US

What do foreign companies do in the US? Who are they? Which US markets are most inviting to foreigners?

This project uses SEC filing from EDGAR to analyze foreign companies activities in US. Does the rising number of foreign bussiness in the US bring competition, challenge or more opportunity? In order to answer the big question, we need to fully understand foreign companies' preference, capacity and actions. Do they act like certain local companies?

Brief introduction of the datasource

EDGAR is the major source of data required by this project. (Supplementary market and macroeconomic information comes from BLS and BEA.)
  EDGAR is free to access to the public. But the filing information is in the form of individual document, such as html file. 
  Who files EDGAR? "All companies, foreign and domestic, are required to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically through EDGAR."(Quoted from SEC) Although small business is not usually required to file with SEC electronicly. Banks file with FDIC and other banking industry regulators.
